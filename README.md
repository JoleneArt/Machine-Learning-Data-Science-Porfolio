## Project focus - 30 projects in construction (running them takes a while)
###### Different projects which each has their own folder uses focused technology or techqiune that I specialize inside the project itself.
###### Although they may have overlapping categories I sorted them,, Here are some of the groups of each sub-field

### Vanilla machine learning projects 
// For the problems that just need a basic ML algorithm
##### ???

### deep learning projects
// Projects utilizing Neural Networks 
##### Medical Diagonse Model

### data science projects

##### ???

### Alternative AI programming
// ML projects that use other than python
##### Pronounce this 

### Explainable AI (XAI)
// Projects that make you wonder how's your model thinking
##### Medical Diagonse Model

### Diffusion models
